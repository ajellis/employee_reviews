# Employee Reviews

This program is designed to create employees and sort them by department, as well as store employee information such as name, email, phone number, and salary.

It also is able to take employee salaries and modify them based on specific parameters.

employee_reviews_test checks each aspect of the code to make sure it is functioning properly. It can also be used to assure that code modifications do not mess up other parts of the code.

Thanks for taking the time to look at my assignment, Mason! I worked hard on it! And thank you for taking time out of your busy life to teach me and equip me with the tools I need to make this into a career. Every day I get a little bit better at this!
